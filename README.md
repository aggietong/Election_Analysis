1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary

The script can be modified for any election, at the senate, state, or country level. Further to that, if there are more data related to voter demographics, additional coding can be built into the script to understand number and percentage of voters by race, age, sex for example for each of the candidates or by region
